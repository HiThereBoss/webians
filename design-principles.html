                Through each page, the layout is similar; the same header exists at the top of the page where users can navigate between different pages such as the men’s section, 
                the women’s section and the home section, making it easy for navigation. On top of this, colours are consistent as well – follows a black and white theme throughout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pages also use very consistent shapes; to display clothing on different pages, boxes and rectangles are used as borders. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each page also has a consistent footer, making it easy to find key information about the company–all it takes is a scroll all the way down to the page.

                The website is quite easy to navigate, it has quick shortcuts which enable users to reach their destination. It also contains shortcuts on each page, allowing for easy navigation.

                When clicking on the “about” page, there seems to be an error message : 404 
                This page does not exist. This messes with the navigation, as it prevents users from quite literally gaining access to the “About” page.

                Looking at the first 3 pages, they do not follow the same styles, clearly not sharing an external CSS stylesheet, 
                also, the header is missing in other pages, making it difficult to get back to the home page.

                There are no links back to the home page or any other pages as soon as a user navigates to a different page,
                random pop-ups appear, making it difficult to navigate the website, links that do exist are hard to see and click.

                Website home page is not optimized for mobile users, images does not use alt text, and the links to other pages are not designed for mobile at all.
